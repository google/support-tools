= Header1 =

This is a test file for verifying the tool's output. You can regenerate
{{{example.md}}} yourself by running:

{{{
python wiki2gfm.py \
    --project=test \
    --wikipages_list="TestPage" \
    --input_file=example.wiki \
    --output_file=example.md
}}}

Note that this is used by {{wiki2gfm_test.py}}, so changing the
arguments will break unit tests.

==== Code (mismatched header sides again) ======

{{{
{{{
def fib(n):
  if n == 0 or n == 1:
    return n
  else:
    # This recursion is not good for large numbers.
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
}}}

Which results in:

{{{

  if n == 0 or n == 1:
    return n
  else:
    # This recursion is not good for large numbers.
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

Which results in:

==== Lists

The following is:
  * A list
  * Of bulleted items
    # This is a numbered sublist
    # Which is done by indenting further
  * And back to the main bulleted list

 * This is also a list
 * With a single leading space
 * Notice that it is rendered
  # At the same levels
  # As the above lists.
 * Despite the different indentation levels.

 Blockquotes are seen as lists. Time to nest:
  Nested!
 Okay back.
